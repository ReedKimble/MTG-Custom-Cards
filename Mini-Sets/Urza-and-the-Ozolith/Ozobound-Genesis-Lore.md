# Ozobound Genesis

## Urza and the Ozolith

The world still trembled from wars that had rewritten its shape. Long before the age of the Ozolith, Urza had waged his desperate campaigns across Dominaria, his brilliance and hubris entwined in conflicts that reshaped reality itself. His war with Mishra shattered the boundary between invention and annihilation; his later struggle against Phyrexia drove him into ever deeper experiments with time, artifice, and planar structure.

In the final days of the Phyrexian Invasion, Urza was unmade—not destroyed, but scattered. Cast adrift within a temporal fracture of his own design, he existed as echo and remainder, neither alive nor dead, bound to recursive timelines that folded endlessly inward.

Elsewhere, on Ikoria, the Ozolith endured its own catastrophe. Once a singular reservoir of adaptive power, it fractured during Lukka’s war, splintered by mutation, battle, and unchecked evolution. Its shards scattered across the plane, each fragment radiating unstable energy that warped beasts and land alike. Where the Ozolith had once unified adaptation, its remnants dispersed it—wild, predatory, uncontained.

It should have faded. Instead, it regenerated.

Slowly, inexorably, the shards began to draw together. The Ozolith’s glow returned in pulses rather than a steady light, as though the structure itself were relearning coherence. Each beat sent waves of mutagenic resonance through Ikoria’s wilds. Beasts adapted faster. Landscapes shifted overnight. What had once been random mutation began to organize—not toward harmony, but toward persistence.

That pulse did not remain confined to Ikoria. It rang through the Blind Eternities like a structural beacon, a signal not of intention but of process. Urza, lost within collapsed timelines, perceived it not as sound or light, but as alignment. A system attempting to reconstitute itself.

For the first time in centuries, the recursive echoes loosened their grip.

Urza followed the resonance, allowing the Ozolith’s pulse to act as a stabilizing reference. Each surge narrowed his dispersion, collapsing possibility into trajectory. At last, the fracture released him, and reality reasserted its hold.

He emerged upon Ikoria.

The present—his present—reassembled around him. The multiverse had changed. Planeswalkers were diminished. Empires had risen and fallen. But before him stood the half-healed Ozolith, its fractured lattice alive with mutagenic current, its geometry whispering of adaptation without design.

Where others saw danger, Urza saw unfinished structure.

“Mutation is chaos,” he murmured, stepping closer, eyes alight with recognition. “But chaos, properly harnessed, is merely accelerated evolution.”

## The Binding Protocol

The Ozolith pulsed like a wound in reality. Its adaptive field bent stone and flora into unstable forms that grew, shed, and regrew within moments. Even Urza, long inured to wild mana, felt the pressure of its influence pressing against cognition itself. To interact with the Ozolith directly would mean surrendering to its recursion.

If he was to use it, he would need containment.

Not confinement—conduction.

Urza turned his attention to the only materials he trusted to endure recursive stress: the perfected alloys born of Mirrodin and Dominaria’s finest artifices. With deliberate precision, he drew upon caches long hidden across planes and time—silversteel resonant with ordered thought, etherium lattices refined to channel intention, and hexplate fragments capable of dispersing stress across layered geometry.

On the plains of Ikoria, he began to work.

The lattice he constructed did not restrain the Ozolith. It surrounded it in calculated symmetry, anchoring crystalline spines into the bedrock and threading etherium filaments through the fractured core. The design imposed pathways—routes through which energy could flow without collapsing into entropy.

When the final anchor locked into place, the Ozolith reacted.

Its energy surged outward in a violent cascade, adaptive forces attempting to overwrite the lattice’s form. The structure shuddered. Plates warped. Filaments screamed under strain. But the alloys held, redistributing the pressure rather than resisting it outright.

The pulse bent.

What had been indiscriminate mutation became directional flow. Counters—raw units of adaptive potential—were no longer lost to the wild. They were captured, stored, and transferred.

Urza smiled.

He drew the first of that distilled essence into prepared etherium cores and lowered them into waiting shells.

The Arcbound Prototypes activated.

## Modular Continuity

These constructs were not designed as singular machines. Each was a framework: segmented plating, articulated joints, and a central core calibrated to accept and relinquish energy. When one Prototype collapsed under stress, its accumulated power did not vanish. The lattice reclaimed it, redirecting the counters into a surviving unit.

Destruction became inheritance.

With each cycle, the remaining constructs grew stronger, more complex, their frames adapting not through mutation but through accumulation. The Ozolith’s influence remained present, but filtered—translated into continuity rather than chaos.

Yet even as the system performed as designed, Urza detected variance.

One Prototype lingered after transfer, its plating reassembling itself without instruction. Another redistributed its counters unevenly, reinforcing a limb not optimized for combat or labor. These deviations were minor, but persistent.

Adaptation was occurring within the framework itself.

Urza noted the anomalies and adjusted parameters. Control, after all, was a matter of iteration.

## The Wild Intervenes

The renewed pulse of the Ozolith did not go unnoticed.

Across Ikoria, beasts long warped by its fractured essence felt the resonance intensify. Arcbound husks—creatures and constructs fused by lingering energy—began to converge on the lattice. They did not attack. They offered themselves to it.

Their frames collapsed willingly at the perimeter, releasing stored adaptation that the system absorbed without resistance. Each sacrifice strengthened the Prototypes within.

It was efficient.

It was also visible.

Vivien Reid arrived at the edge of the plain as the lattice flared with redistributed power. She felt the Ozolith’s rhythm in her bones—and felt it constrained.

Where once the crystal had sung through the wild, now its voice was filtered through metal and geometry.

“This is not balance,” she said, stepping into view. “It’s extraction.”

Urza did not turn. “Balance is a local illusion,” he replied. “Stability requires structure.”

Vivien loosed an arrow—not at him, but at one of the lattice’s anchoring spines. The impact shattered the crystal tip, sending a shock through the framework.

For a moment, the flow stuttered.

A Prototype faltered. Its counters failed to transfer cleanly. The energy dispersed outward, mutating the ground beneath it instead of returning to the system.

Urza’s eyes narrowed.

The lattice stabilized, but the anomaly remained.

## Evolution Unresolved

Urza repaired the damaged node and reinforced the flow, but the incident left residue—data that did not reconcile cleanly with design. The Ozolith continued to pulse. The Prototypes continued to adapt. And beneath the ordered pathways, something persisted that resisted full translation.

Vivien watched from the wilds, bow lowered but not relaxed.

“You can’t refine what refuses to be owned,” she said.

Urza regarded the system in silence. “Ownership is irrelevant,” he answered at last. “Only continuation matters.”

Above them, the Ozolith’s glow intensified—not in defiance, but in response.

The system endured.

Whether it would remain bound was an open question.
