# Urza and the Ozolith

An extension of Darksteel.

A 62-card mini-set ready for selection and mana-base to make a Standard Deck, or expansion with more artifacts into a Commander Deck.

Inspired by my all-time favorite, most powerful deck from back in the day: "The Ravager Deck", a 60-artifact, turn-3-kill, blast to play.  :)

# Lore

A mini-story exists to provide lore for the set and the reappearance of Urza.
